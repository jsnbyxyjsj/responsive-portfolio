  <h3 class="characteristics_title">My Characteristics:</h3>
  <p class="characteristics_description">
    I like the Internet and have been working in social media marketing in the language community YY since high school, building a following of thousands. It all started when I realized my passion for engaging storytelling online. From publishing blog posts on my school's official website to creating video scripts, filming, and editing clips for celebrity blogger events, I love making connections online.
  </p>
  <p class="characteristics_description">
    I have always been a creative person who enjoys producing engaging content that inspires human emotion. Whether it's blog posts or social media headlines, my writing is designed to create genuine connections.
  </p>
  <p class="characteristics_description">
    As someone naturally curious about human behavior, I enjoy evaluating why content spreads and adjusting strategies based on fan engagement data.
  </p>
  <p class="characteristics_description">
    Strategizing is essential when choosing the right platforms to connect with my diverse fan base, empathize with them, and guide branding most effectively. Staying updated with the latest trends allows me to make informed decisions.
  </p>
  <p class="characteristics_description">
    At the end of the day, being a "social media manager" is more than just a title – it's a mindset. It's a passion for building communities and constantly learning, growing, and finding new ways to spark meaningful conversations.
